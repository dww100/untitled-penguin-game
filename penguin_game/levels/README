# Simple text format for level layout

Provide a N by M grid of characters to define the level.
The information below shows the original character map and how updated maps
 are created when new object types are added.

## Original

The original format contains the following objects:

. : Nothing
0: Wall
1: Player start
2: Block
3: Diamond
4: EggBlock
5: Enemy

## Updates

New objects are registered in the `entities.Entities` dictionary.
The `_id` attribute of the entity provides the key in the dictionary.
